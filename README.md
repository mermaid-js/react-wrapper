# Mermaid for React

Mermaid for React is a wrapper for the [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) diagramming library. It supports all mermaid diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, gantt charts, class diagrams, state diagrams, and more). It was developed to add diagram support to [Storybook Docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/addon-docs), but it can be used inside _any_ React project.
